## Overview

The `menus` service is an asynchronous service: once the `deploy` method is
called, it will call the server (using the `/web/webclient/load_menus/...` url) to fetch
the data. Once it is done, the service is available and can be used to query
informations on the menu items.

## API

Here is a description of all exported methods:

-   `get(menuId)`
-   `apps`
-   `getMenusAsTree(...)`
