Access customer account
=======================

Odoo makes it easier than ever before for customers to access their customer account.

Customers are suggested to sign up (name, email, password) only when an order has been placed -
*not* before.

Sign up
=======

The invitation to sign up appears when the customer wants to visualize the order from the order
confirmation email.

Customer account
================

Once logged in, the customer will access the account by clicking *My Account* in the login
dropdown menu.

This is where they will find their history. Their main address (billing) can also be modified here,
as well.

.. note::
   If the customer is set as a contact of a company in your address book, they will see all their
   pertinent documents related to that company.
