Website translation
===================

In addition to creating beautiful, professional-grade websites, Odoo provides users with the ability
to translate them into multiple different languages - at any time.

Translate
=========

To enable translation, go to your website, and scroll down to your footer. Click on the
language (i.e. *English - US*) to reveal a menu, then click *Add a Language*.

Choose the language you want from the language pop-up that appears. You can also decide which
website you'd like to apply it to here, as well. Then, click *Add*.

When you navigate back to your website, that new language is now an option.

When selected, some of the text translates automatically.

To translate the content of the website, click on **Translate** (in the upper-right corner), which
appears in that newly-chosen language.

Here, for example, it's **Traduire**, since we are translating the website in French.

At this point, most of the content is highlighted in yellow or green.

The yellow represents content that you have to translate manually, and green represents content that
has already been translated by Odoo automatically.
