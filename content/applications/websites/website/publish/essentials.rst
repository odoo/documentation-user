Website essentials
==================

With Odoo's *Website* application, anyone can build a beautiful, professional-grade website in just
a matter of minutes. Odoo's uniquely eye-catching design elements, customizable options, and
user-friendly design can help you create a top-notch website for your business without any coding
knowledge whatsoever!

Pick a theme
============

Upon installing the *Website* application, you are redirected to a page full of website themes to
choose from.

Each theme provides its own unique style (and look) that expertly cater to a variety of businesses
or personal purposes.

While they differ in initial design, each theme still provides the user with all the functionality,
options, tools, and features that Odoo has to offer. That way, you can get the most of your website,
no matter what theme you pick.

When you hover over a theme on the *Pick a Theme* page, you are presented with two options: *Use
This Theme* or *Live Preview*.

Clicking *Live Preview* presents you with a sample website in that desired theme. You can also
choose to see it in *Desktop* or *Mobile*.

If you want to choose the theme for your website, simply click *Start Now* in the upper-left
corner. If you'd like to go back to the theme selection page, click *Choose another theme*.

.. tip::
   You can change your theme at any time. From the front-end of the website (in *Edit* mode),
   select *Switch Theme* at the bottom of the *Options* section in the toolbar. From the backend, go
   to :menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings` and select *Pick a Theme* from the
   *Website* section.

Getting started
===============

When a theme is selected, Odoo takes you to a blank homepage (already in *Edit* mode) that you
can start designing with the help of Odoo's toolbar, located on the right-side of the screen.

Building Blocks
===============

Odoo provides the user with a huge collection of helpful design elements (and features) to help
them build their website. The first section you see is **Blocks**, which contains all of Odoo's
eye-catching, easy-to-use *Building Blocks*.

To use these *Building Blocks*, simply drag and drop your desired block anywhere on your page, and
start customizing it to fit the needs of your company.

They are divided into 4 categories:

-  **Structure**: core features that provide foundational elements to your site.

-  **Features**: unique array of informative, attention-grabbing aspects to help your web design
   look more professional and pleasing to visitors.

-  **Dynamic Content**: features designed to showcase more information about the company, its
   location, social presence, and so much more.

-  **Inner Content**: engaging forms of content and design elements that can be directly
   incorporated within other *Building Blocks*

Customize Building Blocks
-------------------------

Once you have dragged and dropped a *Building Block* onto your webpage, you can edit it in a number
of ways. To do so, first select the block you wish to change, and a new set of options appears in
the toolbar that are specific to that block in the *Style* section.

Of course, these options are different for every block, so be sure to consider every
configuration for each design element you place on your webpage, in order to create a truly unique
and memorable style.

Header and Footer
-----------------

When the header or footer of your page is selected, Odoo instantly reveals a new *Style* menu
with options and features specifically designed for these elements of your website.

to play around with these options during the building of your website.
