Forum
=====

Phone lines, email support, and live chat are necessary for excellent customer service, but
adding a support forum can improve satisfaction rates and build a loyal community. A forum
encourages customer engagement, knowledge sharing, and brand trust. By providing a space for
questions and conversation, you'll gain valuable business insights, and your
customers will be happier.

Set up
------

Go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Team`, select a Helpdesk Team, and

eLearning
=========

In addition to a forum, online courses can improve customer experience and save your support team
valuable time. Your customers can find answers themselves through tutorials, and your team
can send links to helpful content rather than writing out lengthy emails.
