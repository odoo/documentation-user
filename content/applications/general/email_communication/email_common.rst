Common issues and frequent questions related to Emails 
======================================================

This document contains an explanation of the most recurring mailing concerns.

We will start by addressing issues of outgoing emails (ex: my client has not received my email), and then, of incoming emails (ex: I do not receive responses from my customers in the database).

Outgoing emails
===============

What do you have to check if your email is not sent?
----------------------------------------------------

The first indicator showing you that the email has not been sent is the red envelope showing next to the date & hour of the message.
If you click on it, you will see why the message was not sent.

Common error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You reached your daily limit:

Each email service provider has its own email sending limits. The limits may be daily, hourly, and sometimes also per minute. And this is the same for Odoo. That limit is in place to prevent our e-mail servers from being blacklisted.

Here are the default limits for new databases:
 - 200 emails/day for Odoo Online and Odoo.sh databases with an active subscription,
 - 50 emails/day for one-app free and trial databases,
 - in case of migration, your daily limit might be reset to 50 emails a day.

In case you hit the limit, you can:
 - either ask our support team to increase your daily limit (we will analyze your situation: how many users in your database, which apps, your bounce ratio…). You can contact the `support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_,
 - either use your own outgoing email server and you are independent of Odoo’s mail limit. In that case, here is our documentation about how to configure it: * How to Use my Mail Server to Send and Receive Emails in Odoo,
 - either wait around 11pm UTC for the reset and click on the retry button of the emails: The :doc:`Developer mode </applications/general/developer_mode/activate>` must be activated. Then, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Emails`

Beware: the daily limit is global to your database and can rise quite fast! You have to know that by default an internal message, a notification, a note, … count as an email in your daily limit if it notify someone.

You can mitigate this by receiving your notifications in Odoo (click on your user on the top right corner of the screen) :menuselection:`My Profile  --> Preferences` and choose “Handle notifications within Odoo” (instead of by email).

SMTP Error
**********

You can find out why an email wasn't transmitted successfully by reviewing the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) error messages. SMTP is a protocol for email format and transmission on the Internet, and the error messages generated by email services are helpful tools for diagnosing and troubleshooting email problems.

No Error
********

Odoo is not always capable of providing the information on the reason it failed. The different providers implement a personalized policy of the bounce emails and it is not always possible for odoo to interpret it correctly.

If you have this problem on a recurring basis with the same client or the same domain, please do not hesitate to contact support for help in finding a reason.

Note: in such case, one of the most common reasons is the SPF / DKIM configuration problem

Why is my email sent late?
**************************

It may happen that you schedule a email campaign but it is not sent on time. You should know that we use the concept of cron for emails that we consider as not urgent (Newsletters concept such as mass mailing, marketing automation, events). The system utility **cron** can be used to schedule programs to run automatically at predetermined intervals. We use that policy in order to avoid cluttering the mail servers and prioritize the communication. 

The emails considered as urgent (communication from a person to another one such as Sales Order, Invoices, Purchase Orders…) are sent directly.

By default, the Mass Mailing cron runs every 60 minutes. So, you should wait an hour before the campaign is actually sent.

Incoming emails
===============

When you have an issue with incoming emails, there might not have  indication per say in Odoo. This is the client who tries to contact a database who will get a bounce (most of the time 550: mailbox unavailable).

Emails are not received
-----------------------

Depending on the platform you are using: 
 - The **Odoo.sh** users can find their live logs on the folder ~/logs/.
 - The folder ~/logs/ (preferably access by the command line) of an Odoo.sh contains a list of files containing logs of the database. The log files are created everyday at 4:00 UTC time. The two last days are not zipped, where the older are zipped in order to gain space. The naming of the files are decremental, which means that the file named .1 is the one from yesterday and the file .2 is the day before yesterday. See the following Odoo.sh documentation about `logs <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/administration/odoo_sh/getting_started/branches.html?#logs>`_. Use the command ``grep`` and ``zgrep`` (for the zipped) to navigate through the files. 
 - The **SaaS** users won’t have access to their logs. However you can still submit a ticket, if you have a recurring issue with the same client or domain.

Get helped from support
-----------------------

In order to get helped efficiently, please provide as much information as possible. Here is a list of what can be helpful:
 - The **EML** of the file, stating for *Electronic Mail*, is the email containing all the technical information requires for an investigation. The documentation of your own provider might help you on how to get your EML files. Once you get the EML of the email, adding it in the attachment of your ticket is the most efficient way for us to investigate. The support will mainly focus on redundant issues.

- The exact flow you are doing in order to normally receive those emails in Odoo. Here is examples of question that can be useful to provide answer:
    - Is this simply a reply from an email going out from Odoo ? 
    - Are you using an incoming email server or somehow redirecting? 
    - Can you provide us with an example of an email that has been correctly forwarded ?

- Providing answers to the following questions: 
	- Is it a generic issue or is it specific to a use case? If yes, which one exactly? 
	- Is it working as expected? In case the email is sent using Odoo, the bounce email should reach the Odoo database and display a red envelope. To be able to investigate, please refer to the subsection envelope is red.
